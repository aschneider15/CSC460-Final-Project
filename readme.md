# Final Project for CSC 460
## Hello, and welcome!
This is my final assignment for CSC 460, which I took during the Spring semester of my Junior year of College. A lot of this is based on units 3, 9, 17, and 18 from [PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites ed. 5](https://github.com/LarryUllman/phpmysqlvqp-5ed) by [Larry Ullman](https://larryullman.com), but I tried to put my own unique spin on it.
## Quick Instructions
When you download this repository, make sure to execute the SQL script in MySQL first. This will set up the database the way it's supposed to be. Otherwise, I'm afraid you might have a hard time getting the darn thing to run.

Make sure if you're running this from an Apache server that you put the entire folder into the /htdocs directory. Make sure, in your web browser, that you go to "localhost:/CSC460-Final-Project/htdocs/index.php" - That last little bit is important.
